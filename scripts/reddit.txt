Think i’m losing my love for gaming, any game that could possibly bring that back?

Like the title says I think my spark for games is starting to dwindle and i really don’t want that to be the case. I’ve tried remnant 2 and didn’t really like it, tried stellar blade and didn’t like it that much either, then i tried playing Nioh, dead island 2, Astro bot and Greedfall and didn’t enjoy any of them. I can’t tell if i’m just too picky or don’t enjoy games anymore I’m a huge fan of darks souls, elden ring and other souls like so i’m kinda surprised when i tried other souls like and i didn’t really enjoy them that much. Also just for reference I don’t enjoy turn based combat games that much but if there’s any that really sticks out i wouldn’t mind trying it. I do like the grim setting that dark souls has so any games that have a setting like that could work.

Edit: Definitely wasn’t expecting 200+ responses, thank you guys for all your recommendations but i’ve decided to do what some other comments have said and take a bit of a break from gaming and explore some other hobbies, though if i feel that urge to play some games again i’ll definitely come back to this post and try out some of your guys recommendations, thank you for commenting again, i really appreciate it
